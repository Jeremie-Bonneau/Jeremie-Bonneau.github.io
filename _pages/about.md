Welcome to this page!

I am a postoctoral researcher at The University of British Columbia in Vancouver (British Columbia) in the environmental fluid mechanics group. My research focuses on ice-ocean interactions in Canadian Arctic glacial fjords. More specifically, I study how the ocean circulation is influenced by coastal ice structures (tidewater glaciers, ice shelves) and in return how the fate of these ice structures is linked to the ocean circulation. My main field site is Milne Fiord, on the north coast of Ellesmere Island. Every summer during fieldwork in Milne Fiord, we collect water profiles and service the oceanographic moorings. Since researchers have been going to Milne Fiord since 2011, this provides an observational record more than a decade long. I use these observations to validate a three-dimensional numerical model of the ocean which is used to study the circulation inside Milne Fiord and on the coastal shelf. 

The questions I am asking are: 1) What are the main mechanisms driving the circulation and the heat fluxes in Milne Fiord? 2) How are the ice structures in Milne Fiord influencing the circulation and heat fluxes? and 3) How will this change in the future? Although these questions have been partly answered for Greenlandic fjords, there is still a need to improve our understanding of these systems. This is especially true for Canadian Arctic glacial fjords, less studied than their Greenlandic cousins. 

More broadly, my interests span the intersection of fluid mechanics and the environment such as turbulence, exchange flows, limnology, or other complex processes that govern natural water systems. In adition to my research at UBC, I am also active in engineering consulting, where I apply principles of fluid mechanics to real-world challenges in environmental preservation, water quality management, and sustainable infrastructure planning. This dual engagement allows me to bridge theory and practice, ensuring that my scientific work remains grounded in pressing environmental needs.

When I am not working on my computer or in the field, you can find me skiing in the mountains around Vancouver (November to June), mountain biking (June-September) or fly fishing (October-November). Please feel free to email me for any question on the work I do!
